we are here to breakdown the project.....
here are step by step structure to built this app

1. first of all , we have to install react-router-dom , axios, infinite player 
   we have option for remix iconc (we install that or cdn link).

2. now we have to create a component folder inside the src folder..... inside the component folder we have to built the components of the project 
here is the list of components
{ HOME.JSX,


}
3. and we also create a folder inside the src folder , which name is templates .... inside the templates we create a {SideNva.jsx}
4. the next step is to create a side nav {the code of side nav in side nav.jsx file you can see this}
5. after complete the structure of side nav now we created a top nav .jsx in the templete folder...now we have side nav and top nav components in the templates and we add that in home .jsx
 20% width covered by the side nav and other 80% width are covered by the div which contains many thing but now we have top nav inside this
